# Budgety

> A simple monthly budget app which helps to track income and expense and help you to take an efficient financial decision. 

> I made this project as part of my Javascript course on Udemy :- [The Complete JavaScript Course 2018: Build Real Projects!](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course/)

> I learned few new concepts of javascript like Modular pattern Development, event bubbling, event delegation, prototype chain, data privacy, DOM manipulation, DOM traversal, how to use IIFE, how to make API like modules using IIFE, etc..
